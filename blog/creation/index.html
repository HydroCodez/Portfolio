                    My old portfolio was really uneditable, scuffed, overcomplicated, parts were too unnecessary, unreadable, stacked in piles of unsimplified code; you get the idea.
                    This isn't what code should be. So I reinvented it. And here it is! Dark, easy on the eyes, clean, simplified, not overcomplicated, nothing too unnecessary, easy-to-read
                    code, editable, aesthetically pleasing and overall quite well made. I can now easily add more parts with a more intuitive format (mostly lol) and not too much code (contrasting
                    to other projects I made, e.g. TA-Dracula, which collectivly had around 2000 lines of code.) It's safe to say I like this one way better than my last.
